      <p class="page" animate__flash>Parallax website content refers to the visual design technique where background
        images or content
        move at a slower pace than foreground content as a user scrolls down the page, creating an illusion of depth and

        component move over the background to create the parallax scrolling effect. To create the parallax scrolling
        effect, I'll need the background-attachment: fixed element in CSS. </p>
